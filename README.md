# Fine-Tune FLAN-T5_with_Reinforcement Learning (PPO)
 In this project, we fine-tune a FLAN-T5 model to generate less toxic content with Meta AI's hate speech reward model. The reward model is a binary classifier that predicts either "not hate" or "hate" for the given text. You will use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune and reduce the model's toxicity.
